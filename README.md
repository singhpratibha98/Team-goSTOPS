 > I have created this navigation bar using the flex property. First, I built the main nav element, inside which I added two separate divs — one for the goStops logo and another for the navigation content. In the content div, I used a ul tag containing multiple li elements (list items). I applied display: flex and justify-content: space-around to distribute the list items evenly. At the end of the navigation bar, I added two buttons: one for Download Now and the other for Login.

Below the navbar, I added another div that contains an image of Karnataka. Alongside the image, I created another div for text content, where I included the title "Karnataka Trip" using h1 and h2 tags. For layout positioning, I used the position property — setting the parent div to relative and the child div to absolute — to properly position the elements.

This is the main section, in which I added a container div. Inside this container, I created three separate divs.
In the first div, I added an image along with a button that includes a location icon, which I imported from Font Awesome.
The second div is for content. I applied display: flex to this div and added an icon, a <p> tag for descriptive text, and an <h3> tag for the title.
The third div is used to display the price, where the rate is shown clearly.

Then, I created the Subscribe section, where I added a main div, and within it, another div for the content. I used display: flex to align the elements. Inside this content div, I included an <h2> tag for the heading and a <p> tag for the supporting text.

The Footer section was also built using the flex property. In this section, I created a parent div, and inside it, another div for the content layout. I applied display: flex, set a background color, and styled the text color appropriately. I also used a ul tag to list all the footer content items in an organized manner.

Finally, I added a WhatsApp icon, which is fixed across all sections of the page. I made it sticky using the position: sticky property, and styled it with some border-radius, cursor: pointer, and specified its height and width for consistent appearance.
